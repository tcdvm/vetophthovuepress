# Compounding Pharmacies

Compounding pharmacies are heavily utilized in veterinary ophthalmology for creation of ophthalmic medications in higher concentrations than what is commerciably available (e.g. 2% cyclosporine) or if/when medications are unavailable/on-backorder. 

Local compounding pharmacies vary in ability to compound ophthalmics (some require sterile environments or special agents) so ordering from larger compounding pharmacies is typically easier and some have undergone rigorous certification which potentially translates to more reliable formulations or the ability to stock the medications and dispense from the clinic.

Typically the prescription is called into the pharmacy and the pharmacy will then contact the owner for payment and delivery instructions.

Below are some of the compounding pharamcies available that deliver nationally.
