## Conjunctival Anatomy and Physiology

1.  The conjunctiva is the most exposed mucous membrane of the body.
2.  The conjunctiva is divided into three areas:
    - Palpebral conjunctiva
    - Conjunctival fornix
    - Bulbar conjunctiva
3.  The conjunctiva is a two-layered structure
    - Superficial: Non-keratinized epithelium with goblet cells
    - Deep: Substantia propria with lymphocyte and fibrous layers

## Conjunctivitis

### Pathologic responses

- Acute: Hyperemia, cellular exudates, edema (chemosis), ocular discharge, blepharospasm
- Chronic: Goblet cell proliferation, keratinization, and follicle formation.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis

A rarely occurring primary bacterial infection of the conjunctiva leading to purulent discharge and conjunctival hyperemia.

Diagnostics:

- Culture, cytology (should see neutrophils and bacteria), MUST RULE OUT KCS, dacryocystitis, and eyelid disease.

Treatment:

- Start with broad spectrum topical antibiotic, if severe may need systemic antibiotics

### Chronic allergic conjunctivitis

Often a seasonal disease related to atopy, causes a conjunctival hyperemia and mucoid discharge.
Diagnostics:

- Seasonal, cytology shows lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils

Treatment:

- Treat the allergy with desensitization if appropriate, topical or systemic antihistamines +/- topical hydrocortisone temporarily

### Acute allergic conjunctivitis

Acute profuse chemosis and hyperemic eyelids, usually secondary to a bee sting or other acute insult.

Diagnostics:

- Often have a history of a bee sting or of being outside.

Treatment:

- Make sure airway is okay. Use artificial tear ointment if blinking is inhibited. One dose of systemic diphenhydramine and dexamethasone +/- topical steroid.

### Viral conjunctivitis

Caused by canine distemper virus. Seen with the early stages of disease.

Diagnostics:

- General clinical signs, history

Treatment:

- Topical antibiotics for secondary infection, check tear production as CDV can cause KCS

### Follicular conjunctivitis

Abnormal proliferation of lymphoid follicles that develop on the conjunctiva, including both sides of the nictitans, secondary to antigenic stimulation. Seen most commonly in younger dogs with deep orbits such as Labradors.

Diagnostics:

- Appearance of vesicles approximately 2mm in diameter, cytology reveals lymphocytes

Treatment:

- Treat with topical dexamethasone first. If no response, rub the follicles with a gauze covered Q-tip to rupture them and continue treating with the corticosteroids.

### Physical irritation

From drugs, wind, dust, eyelid disease such as entropion and ectropion.

Treatment:

- Complete eye exam and treatment of specific diseases.

## Other conjunctival diseases

### Conjunctival hemorrhage

Diffuse, petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages within the conjunctiva

Etiologies:

- Trauma, RMSF, choke collars, blood dyscrasias etc.

Diagnostics:

- History, physical examination, CBC, panel, coag, etc. when indicated.

Treatment:

- Treat primary disease. No treatment necessary if it is secondary to trauma if the rest of the eye is normal.

## Conjunctival neoplasia

A rare occurrence, a mass is seen within the conjunctiva.
