Two sets of blood vessels are on the globe surface and contribute to an
eye being “blood shot.” . Conjunctival . Episcleral

Conjunctival hyperemia
======================

Diagnosis
---------

-   Small, branching blood vessels

-   Blanch with topical epinephrine/phenylephrine

-   Can be moved with a cotton swab

Causes
------

-   Conjunctivitis

-   KCS

-   Eyelid abnormalities

Episcleral injection
====================

Diagnosis
---------

-   Big corded vessels radiating away from the limbus

-   Don’t blanch right away with phenylephrine

-   Don’t wiggle when a cotton swab is used to move the conjunctiva

Causes
------

-   Intraocular disease such as

    -   Anterior uveitis

    -   Glaucoma

    -   Episcleritis

Note: Both conjunctival and episcleral vessels can be injected at the
same time. For example if a dog has glaucoma (which is painful) he may
rub the eye causing secondary conjunctival disease.

Note: This is not always completely clear - the point is that you
realize that a red eye may be the first sign you see of a blinding
disease.

Any time that you see a patient with a ‘red eye’ you as the veterinarian
need to rule out:

1.  Corneal ulceration

2.  KCS

3.  Anterior uveitis

4.  Glaucoma
