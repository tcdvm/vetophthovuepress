There are a number of ocular conditions faced by both large and small
animal veterinarians that require surgical intervention to prevent
serious ocular dysfunction, blindness, or loss of an eye. They include
conditions of some urgency, such as descemetoceles or corneal
lacerations, as well as more routine clinical conditions, such as
entropion or lid tumor removal. This handout will concentrate on some
general principles of ophthalmic surgical instrumentation and technique,
as well as brief descriptions of selected surgical procedures involving
the eyelids, nictitans, conjunctiva, and cornea.

Ophthalmic Surgical Instrumentation
===================================

For most ocular surgeries, including those dealing with emergency
situations, a small number of general purpose ophthalmic instruments
will suffice. As the complexity of the procedure increases, the need for
instruments with very specific functions increases. Additionally,
surgeries requiring handling, cutting and suturing of the cornea or
intraocular structures require specific microsurgical instruments to
prevent undue trauma of the ocular tissues. Finally, for many of these
procedures some sort of magnification is beneficial, and for some it is
essential.

Magnification
-------------

-   Plastic head loupes (or “Optivisors') are quite adequate. They are
    inexpensive, and some come with multiple lens systems for different
    degrees of magnification. Three to five times mag is needed for most
    procedures. Some practice is required to work under magnification as
    the surgeon’s proprioceptive responses are altered by the altered
    visual environment. Also, as magnification increases the depth of
    field decreases, further compounding the difficulty working under
    high magnification.

-   Spectacle mounted lenses (e.g., Keeler glasses or Zeiss-Gullstrand
    glasses) offer much improved optics and superior visualization, but
    are much more expensive.

-   At the top of the magnification line are operating microscopes.
    Modern scopes contain optical and lighting combinations that can’t
    be approached by other means of magnification, but they exceed the
    cost of even spectacle mounted lenses many-fold.

Forceps
-------

-   Bishop Harmon - General purpose; grasping lids; can get with fine
    teeth for conjunctival and corneal work.

-   Colibri or McPherson - Two types of corneal forceps. Light, well
    balanced and have delicate teeth for grasping cornea. Very helpful
    in corneal laceration repair and placement of conjunctival grafts
    that require suturing directly to cornea. They can be purchased with
    a “tying platform,” a flattened area behind the teeth which is used
    for grasping and tying fine suture materials. These forceps can also
    be used for manipulating the conjunctiva.

Scissors
--------

-   Stevens' tenotomy scissors - Veterinary ophthalmic surgeons use
    these as general purpose scissors when cutting conjunctiva. The tips
    of both arms are blunted, and they are available in straight or
    curved models. These scissors should only be used on conjunctiva,
    never on skin.

-   Wescott tenotomy scissors - Same general description as Stevens',
    but have a springed mechanism.

Needle holders
--------------

-   For suture sizes 6-0 and larger, a small pair of conventional needle
    holders are recommended. For sizes 7-0 and smaller, which are
    usually recommended for suturing cornea, special microsurgical
    needle holders are needed to offer proper control of the needle, to
    assist in grasping and tying suture, and to prevent bending the
    small needles. There are several varieties available that differ in
    only minor respects. Most are available in either locking or non-
    locking varieties.

-   Castroviejo

-   McPherson

-   Barraquer

-   Troutman

Eyelid Specula
--------------

-   For keeping the lids out of the surgical field when operating on
    cornea or conjunctiva.

-   Barraquer - A light, inexpensive wire speculum that is quite
    adequate for most procedures; only drawback is that retraction power
    can’t be increased beyond the tension inherent in the wire.

-   Castroviejo (and similar models) - Have retraction jaws that are
    parted by twisting a threaded mechanism. Advantage is increased
    traction power, disadvantage is increased weight.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   Muscle or “Strabismus” Hooks - While intended for isolating
    extraocular muscles, these instruments are valuable in veterinary
    ophthalmology for general purpose retraction and probing.

-   Cyclodialysis spatulas - Useful for replacing prolapsed iris into
    the anterior chamber.

-   Lacrimal cannulas (23 - 27 gauge) - Useful for reinflating the
    anterior chamber following corneal laceration / perforation repair.

-   Cellulose spears (e.g., Weck Spears) - For blotting blood and other
    fluids out of the surgical field when the interior of the eye is
    exposed. Unlike cotton tipped applicators, cellulose spears will not
    leave microscopic cotton fibers in the eye to act as an inflammatory
    nidus.

General Principles
==================

-   Positioning - Not so critical for procedures of the lids and
    nictitans, but for corneal surgery this is a major key to a
    successful surgery. Placing animals in dorsal recumbency and placing
    the neck in flexion so that the plane tangential to the corneal axis
    is horizontal makes for the best exposure. In this position,
    however, it is important to remember that the tight bend placed on
    the endotracheal tube may kink it; an armoured tube should be used
    to prevent this complication.

-   Surgical prep - In most instances eyelid hair should be clipped and
    the lashes trimmed. A 10:1 dilution of Betadine solution (not scrub)
    can safely be used to irrigate the lids, conjunctiva and cornea.
    Three applications to each surface separated by a flush with sterile
    saline (not alcohol) are adequate. The final application of Betadine
    should be followed by a thorough sterile saline flush to make
    certain all traces of betadine have been rinsed away. If there is a
    full thickness corneal or scleral wound, prep the cornea with
    sterile saline only as betadine solution can cause uveitis if it
    gets inside the eye.

-   Draping - A non-fenestrated clear plastic adhesive drape (e.g.,
    Steri-drape®, 3-M) or Huck towels may be used as the initial drape.
    We prefer to follow this with a 20" X 20" cloth drape with a 2-3
    inch diameter round, hemmed, centrally placed fenestration. This
    drape is clamped into place and a slit is cut in the plastic drape
    over the surgical field. A large area drape may then be placed over
    the entire surgical field to prevent contamination during instrument
    passage.

Tissue handling
---------------

-   Any time ocular tissues are being manipulated, sutured, cut, etc.,
    the surgeon should be seated with his/her arms resting on chair
    mounted arm supports or on the edge of the surgery table.

-   Eyelids - The edge of a lid laceration or incision should be handled
    as little as possible to avoid induction of excessive swelling and
    loss of proper anatomic orientation.

-   Conjunctiva - The conjunctiva should only be handled with
    lightweight forceps; if using toothed forceps, they should have
    delicate teeth to avoid unnecessary tearing of this fragile tissue.
    Remember that the conjunctiva itself is very thin; the bulk of the
    tissue superficial to the sclera is Tenon’s capsule and other
    fibrous tissue, which must be dissected away from the conjunctiva
    for most conjunctival grafting techniques.

-   Cornea - Should only be handled with forceps made for this purpose.
    Never grasp the full thickness of the cornea, as the “underside” arm
    of the corneal forceps will abrade the corneal endothelium.
    Similarly, whenever an instrument is introduced into the anterior
    chamber (for example, a spatula for breaking down synechiae or
    removing fibrin clots associated with a corneal perforation) care
    must be taken not to let the instrument contact the endothelium.
    When the cornea is being manipulated, the surgeon’s eyes should
    never stray from the cornea. If one attempts to look away even for
    an instant (to locate another instrument on the Mayo stand, for
    instance), the hand holding the corneal forceps will invariably
    shift a small amount which could result in corneal damage. When
    placing corneal sutures, the needle should be driven with a rolling
    motion of the fingers, not gross movements of the wrists as in other
    suturing techniques. Most other instruments applied to the cornea
    should also be manipulated with finger movements. Finally, the
    cornea should be moistened periodically with a LRS or BSS irrigation
    solution to prevent dessication, which can occur rapidly when the
    lids are held open under hot surgical lights.

Sutures
-------

-   Sizes - Conjunctiva and lids are usually best sutured with 5-0 or
    6-0. 7-0 is the largest suture that should be used in the cornea,
    with 8-0 and 9-0 being the preferred sized for corneal work. The
    optimal suture for many corneal procedures is 10-0, but special
    microsurgical instruments (beyond the capabilities of the forceps
    and needle holders described above) are usually needed to handle
    material of this size.

-   Materials

    -   Braided absorbables - e.g., Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl®) or
        Polyglycolic acid (Dexon®). These materials can be used in lids,
        conjunctiva or cornea. In lid surgeries it is best to use a
        braided material if there is a danger of the suture ends rubbing
        across the cornea (e.g., entropion surgery).

    -   Monofilament nonabsorbables - e.g., Nylon (Ethilon®) or
        polypropylene (Prolene®). Very good material for cornea and
        lids, as it is considerably less reactive than polyglactin or
        PGA; however, it needs to be removed and removal of these small
        materials can be difficult, especially from the cornea (it
        should be pointed out that, in selected circumstances, nylon can
        be left in the cornea indefinitely if 8-0 or smaller with
        special knotting). In lid surgeries it is best to use a
        monofilament material if there is a danger of the shaft of the
        suture rubbing across the cornea (e.g., temporary tarsorrhaphy).

-   Needles - For work on lids, conjunctiva or cornea, a cutting needle
    or some variant of a cutting needle (e.g., micro-point, spatula, or
    micro-point spatula) is preferred. All of these tissues contain a
    significant connective tissue component, so that tapered needles as
    small as those swaged onto ocular surgery suture material will often
    bend and not drive properly. Much of the ophthalmic suture material
    on the market is available double armed. It is best to use double
    armed suture because these small needles become dull quickly, and it
    is more efficient and cost effective to have a new needle available
    without having to open another package of suture material.

Surgical Procedures of the Eyelids
==================================

-   Entropion

    -   Most commonly seen in Chow Chows, Shar Peis, English Bulldogs,
        Rottweilers, and retriever breeds.

    -   The severity of the clinical signs depends on the severity of
        the entropion, and can range from mild blepharospasm and
        epiphora to chronic corneal ulceration.

    -   The majority of cases respond well to a simple removal of a
        crescent shaped piece of skin adjacent to the affected area (the
        “modified Holz- Celsus” procedure) (Figure 1).

        -   The first incision is 2.5-3 mm from and parallel to the lid
            margin. The haired/non-haired junction is a good landmark,
            as it is about 1.5-2 mm from the margin. This is facilitated
            by use of a lid plate.

        -   The second incision connects the medial and lateral extents
            of the first in a crescent shaped fashion, and the
            intervening piece of skin is removed. The amount of skin
            removed varies and depends on the severity of the entropion.
            For beginners, a 5 mm width will often prove effective.

        -   The incisions are then sutured in a simple interrupted
            pattern, thus everting the offending lid away from the
            cornea. The first suture should be in the middle of the
            crescent with subsequent sutures bisecting the remaining
            incision.

-   Lid Tumor Removal

    -   Most tumors of the eyelids are benign, but can interfere with
        lid function if large enough. Therefore removal is often
        indicated.

    -   The most useful technique for tumor removal is the full
        thickness wedge resection (see Figure 2).

        -   An imaginary triangle is outlined around the tumor, with the
            lid margin serving as the base of the triangle. The length
            of the base and sides should be adequate to allow for 1-2 mm
            of grossly normal skin all the way around the tumor.

        -   Incisions for the sides of the triangle are made full
            thickness through the eyelid, and should include the skin,
            orbicularis oculi muscle, tarsus, and conjunctiva using a
            \#15 blade. This is facilitated by use of a lid plate.

        -   The eyelid stroma (the tissue between the conjunctiva and
            the skin; includes orbicularis muscle and tarsus) is closed
            in a simple continuous pattern or several interrupted
            sutures beginning at the apex of the wedge. Use care to
            prevent perforation of the conjunctiva with the suture as
            the suture would abrade the cornea.

        -   The skin is closed, starting with a figure-8 suture at the
            lid margin and progressing toward the apex of the wedge with
            simple interrupted sutures.(Fig.3)

        -   A topical antibiotic/corticosteroid preparation may be
            applied 3 times a day for 5 days.

    -   If the tumor is large, a pentagonal resection can be performed
        in a manner similar to that just described, but the pentagonal
        shape will allow for wider surgical margins (see Fig. 4).

    -   In either technique, placement of the figure-8 suture (Fig.3) at
        the margin is critical to assure a smooth margin, thus
        preventing postoperative cicatricial entropion.

    -   If the tumor is large enough to require removal of more than 1/3
        the length of the lid in a large-fissured dog (e.g., Cocker
        Spaniel) or 1/4 the lid length of a cat or tight-fissured dog
        (e.g., Schnauzer), more extensive blepharoplastic procedures are
        required.

-   Lid Laceration

    -   Always inspect the globe for damage.

    -   Primary closure always advised to prevent exposure keratitis
        and/or cicatricial entropion.

    -   Frequently presents as an “L” shaped tear with one arm
        perpendicular to the lid margin and the other along the base of
        the tarsus.

    -   The sooner the lacerated flap is replaced, the less tissue
        devitalization. Even if considerable time has passed between
        injury and repair, the flaps will often heal with primary
        intention due to excellent conjunctival and palpebral vascular
        supply.

    -   Wounds should be checked thoroughly for embedded foreign
        material, then rinsed well with physiological saline. If the
        wound is more than 24 hours old, it should be considered
        infected and cultured. If less than 24 hours, it should be
        considered contaminated.

    -   Broad spectrum perioperative antibiotics are always indicated,
        with postoperative antibiotics being used as well if the wound
        is infected.

    -   Flush the wound with a 8:1 dilution of Betadine solution, then
        re-flush with saline.

    -   Full thickness wounds should be closed in 2 layers:
        subconjunctival and skin (see Fig. 3). Most often no debridement
        is necessary; however, when it is needed minimal debridement
        should be done.

        -   Subcutaneous/stromal layer is simple continuous or
            interrupted pattern. Start suture at point farthest from the
            lid margin. Suture throws should be parallel to the skin
            surface and should not penetrate the conjunctiva. Final
            throw should result in good margin-to-margin apposition with
            the knot buried away from the margin and away from the
            conjunctiva.

        -   For skin sutures, always start with the marginal suture. A
            figure-8 suture results in good apposition and leaves the
            knot away from the cornea (Fig.3). If the wound is in the
            canthal area, however, the figure-8 pattern should be
            avoided as it results in rolling in of the lids. In this
            instance a horizontal mattress may be used. Subsequent
            sutures are simple interrupted. Good margin-to-margin
            apposition is the single most important step in this
            procedure to help prevent post- operative keratitis.

    -   If the wound is in the area of the medial canthus, the
        nasolacrimal puncta should be identified and the integrity of
        the canaliculi verified. If torn, the canaliculi should be
        cannulated with a 2-0 or 3-0 monofilament suture or small bore
        polyethylene tubing. This cannula should be drawn out of the
        nostril if possible and secured to the skin at both ends. The
        wound is then closed as described above, and the cannula is
        removed in 3-4 weeks. A topical antibiotic/corticosteroid
        solution is used to help maintain potency of the duct.

Surgical Procedures of the Cornea
=================================

-   Lamellar Keratectomy (see Figure 5)

    -   Common indications for lamellar keratectomy include corneal
        neoplasia, feline corneal sequestration, and corneal dermoids.
        Less common indications include dense corneal pigmentation and
        indolent corneal ulceration.

    -   The lesion to be excised is identified and the perilesional
        surgical margin is determined.

    -   Proper magnification is very helpful for this procedure.

    -   A \#15 scalpel blade on a Bard-Parker handle or a \#64 Beaver
        ophthalmic scalpel is used to incise the cornea around the
        lesion.

    -   Attaining proper depth of the outlining incisions requires some
        degree of practice, as determination of depth is more tactile
        than visual.

    -   Once the outlining incisions have been completed, one of the
        incised edges is grasped with a corneal forceps and elevated.
        Either the scalpel blade or a spatula is inserted between the
        elevated flap and underlying corneal stroma in a tangential
        fashion and used to undermine the lesion.

    -   This process is continued until the lesion has been removed.

    -   In severely diseased corneas, neovascularization may result in
        bleeding, thus obscuring the surgeon’s view. In these cases
        topical application of phenylephrine or epinephrine during the
        procedure may be helpful, as will frequent lavage of the
        surgical field with balanced salt solution and blotting with
        sterile cotton tipped applicators.

-   Conjunctival Graft

    -   Medical therapy may be attempted initially in treatment of
        MMP-type ulceration. If the ulceration continues to progress
        rapidly despite medical therapy, or if descemetocele formation
        or perforation has already occurred, immediate surgical
        intervention is indicated.

    -   All such ulcers should be cultured and aggressive antibiotic
        therapy (i.e., every 1-2 hours) instituted if indicated.

    -   The most useful surgical technique for these cases is
        conjunctival grafting, of which several varieties are available.
        These grafts not only provide much needed structural support,
        they also provide a healthy blood supply to promote healing and
        several serum anti-collagenase compounds (e.g., alpha-2
        macroglobulin and alpha-2 antitrypsin) to retard corneal
        melting. In all varieties of conjunctival grafting an attempt
        should be made to harvest only the thin conjunctiva, as adherent
        Tenon’s capsule will result in graft retraction 2-3 days
        postoperatively. The bed of the ulcer should be gently scraped
        with a scalpel blade to ensure that all epithelium has been
        denuded from its surface. This will help promote graft
        retention. Also, all necrotic and malacic corneal stroma should
        be removed. Six to eight weeks following graft placement, the
        graft is incised at its limbal attachment and at the edge of the
        ulcer (this does not apply to island grafts or the
        corneoconjunctival transposition). The graft will have adhered
        over the ulcer. Some advocate therapy with topical steroids at
        this point, to accelerate reduction in scar tissue, but the
        ultimate degree of scarring will probably be the same with or
        without the use of steroids.

    -   Pedicle graft (see Figure 6A/B). Can be used for essentially any
        ulcer except those that occupy a large portion of the cornea
        (i.e., approximately 75% of the diameter of the cornea) or those
        that are melting so rapidly that the sutures would be in danger
        of dehiscence.

        -   The diameter of the area to be covered is determined, as
            this will determine the width of the pedicle (Figure 6A).

        -   In most cases it is easiest to harvest the conjunctiva from
            the lateral aspect of the globe. An incision using tenotomy
            scissors is made in the conjunctiva perpendicular to the
            limbus leaving about 1 mm of conjunctiva at the limbus then
            extending the incision the width of the lesion plus 3 mm to
            allow for tissue contraction. For a centrally located lesion
            on the right eye, this incision is begun at the 9 o’clock
            position.

        -   The incised conjunctival edge is grasped with a fine forceps
            and tenotomy scissors are used to undermine and thin the
            conjunctiva dorsally.

        -   A 2nd incision is then made from the lateral extent of the
            first incision and extended dorsally. This incision should
            extend to a point tangential to the lateral edge of the
            ulcer. The pedicle should be hinged dorsally in most cases.

        -   A 3rd conjunctival incision is made parallel to the limbus
            and 1 mm peripheral to it; this incision also begins at the
            9 o’clock position, but is continued dorsally to a point
            tangential to the medial edge of the lesion.

        -   The pedicle is then rotated down over the lesion and sutured
            to the edge of the lesion. If the lesion being covered is a
            melting ulcer, the necrotic edges should be debrided to
            healthy cornea so that there will be a healthy edge on which
            to suture. Simple interrupted sutures should be placed every
            1-2 mm all the way around the lesion (Figure 6B). If
            perforation has occurred, an additional suture should be
            placed through the rotated arm of the pedicle, taking care
            not to place the suture in such a location that major blood
            vessels are ligated. If this "pedicle arm" suture is needed,
            it is usually easiest to place it first. The precise
            location of the pedicle can be altered from the scenario
            above in order to facilitate conjunctival harvesting.
            However, the final direction of the pedicle should not stray
            from the vertical for more than 45° or blinking will tend to
            encourage dehiscence of the pedicle. Also, for very large
            lesions, placement of a temporary lateral tarsorrhaphy will
            help prevent dehiscence; this can be taken down in one to
            two weeks.

Temporary Tarsorrhaphy
======================

A tarsorrhaphy is used to protect the eye. It is most frequently used in
horses but is indicated in small animals with exophthalmic eyes. It is
used to prevent corneal exposure and protect the cornea after surgery in
exophthalmic dogs and horses and to replace a proptosed globe. It can be
partial or complete. Usually a space is left medially to allow globe
visualization and to allow for application of medications.
