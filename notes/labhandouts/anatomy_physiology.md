In this section, students will be introduced to those anatomical and
physiological concepts that are important to the study of ocular
disease. In general, comments on pathophysiology will be covered in
lectures dealing with each ocular structure. It will be very important
to review the following notes prior to those lectures.

Orbit
=====

-   Cavity that contains eye; cone shaped, with apex posteriorly

Osteology
---------

-   Horse, cow: complete bony orbit

-   Dog, cat: bony orbit is incomplete dorsolaterally; orbital ligament
    spans from zygomatic process of frontal bone to frontal process of
    zygomatic arch

-   Optic foramen: optic nerve, internal ophthalmic artery

-   Orbital fissure (orbitorotundum in cow): CNs 3,4, &6, ophthalmic br.
    of CN 5, superior ophthalmic vein.

Vasculature
-----------

-   External ethmoidal artery and external ophthalmic artery (branch of
    maxillary artery) Superior and inferior ophthalmic veins → orbital
    plexus → cavernous sinus Angular vein medially

Innervation
-----------

Sensory  
CN 2 and ophthalmic branch of CN 5

Motor  
To extraocular muscles and levator palpebrae

-   CN 3: dorsal rectus, medial rectus, ventral rectus, ventral oblique,
    levator palpebrae

-   CN 4: superior oblique

-   CN 6: lateral rectus, retractor bulbi

Sympathetic  
Ill-defined orbital musculature (sometimes termed "muscularis
orbitalis"), responsible for maintaining orbital tone.

Extraocular muscles
-------------------

-   Originate around orbital fissure; rectus muscles insert approx. 5-7
    mm posterior to the limbus, retractor bulbi inserts just behind
    equator of globe.

-   Dorsal, medial, ventral and lateral recti turn globe in their
    respective directions.

-   Retractor bulbi pulls globe posteriorly

-   Dorsal oblique causes intorsion (i.e., 12 o’clock position of globe
    moves medially) via the trochlea, ventral oblique causes extorsion
    (i.e., 12 o’clock position moves laterally)

Periorbital fat
---------------

-   Occupies dead space in and around the muscle cone.

Periorbita
----------

-   Periosteum lining the orbital cavity.

Tenon’s capsule
---------------

-   Reflection of periorbita over muscles and globe.

Retrobulbar area
----------------

-   Term used to describe area behind posterior to the globe.

Globe
=====

Three approximately concentric spheres  
1.  Fibrous tunic - cornea anteriorly, sclera posteriorly

2.  Vascular tunic - iris anteriorly, ciliary body in middle, choroid
    posteriorly

3.  Neural tunic - retina

Anterior segment vs. posterior segment  
Anterior segment defined as lens and all structures anterior to it;
posterior segment is defined as all structures posterior to the lens.

Fluid chambers of the eye  
-   Anterior chamber - between cornea and iris; contains aqueous humor

-   Posterior chamber - between ciliary body and iris; also contains
    aqueous humor

-   Vitreous chamber - behind lens; contains vitreous humor and
    constitutes 80% of eye volume.

Adnexa
======

**Overview** \* Defined as orbit and contents, eyelids,
lacrimal/nasolacrimal structures, conjunctiva, nictitans; the following
discussion covers all of the above except orbit (covered previously).

Eyelids
-------

### Gross anatomy

-   Palpebral fissure - opening between upper and lower lids.

-   Medial and lateral canthi - medial and lateral corners of palpebral
    fissure.

### Histologic anatomy

-   Muscles

    -   Levator - raises lid; innervated by CN 3; acts in conjunction
        with dorsal rectus.

    -   Muller’s muscle - sympathetically controlled muscle that
        provides some tone to upper lid and helps raise upper lid during
        flight or fight response.

    -   Orbicularis oculi - closes palpebral fissure; innervated by
        CN 7.

    -   Lateral angular retractor - also called lateral palpebral
        (canthal) ligament; maintains almond shape to palpebral fissure;
        important landmark during enucleation.

    -   Medial palpebral (or canthal) ligament - Also helps maintain
        almond shape to fissure.

-   Glands

    -   Tarsal (aka Meibomian) - Row of glands just under the
        conjunctiva approx. 4 mm posterior to the lid margin. Duct goes
        from gland to pore on eyelid margin. Phospholipid secretion that
        contributes to the tear film.

    -   Zeis - open into ciliary follicles; sebaceous secretion.

    -   Moll - open onto margin near cilia; modified sweat gland.

-   Tarsal plate (also called "tarsus"): Fibrous tissue that gives lid
    form and support; relatively poorly developed in domestic animals.

-   Nasolacrimal puncta: Upper and lower openings in the conjunctiva
    near the medial canthus; function to drain tears away from the eye.

-   Cilia: "Eyelashes" - located on anterior surface of upper lid near
    the margin in most species; cats lack cilia.

### Physiology

-   Upper lid more mobile, closes from lateral to medial to spread tears
    and direct them into the nasolacrimal puncta.

-   Limits entry of light into the eye.

-   Protection of globe via palpebral reflex and menace response.

Lacrimal/Nasolacrimal system
----------------------------

### Pre-corneal tear film - 3 layers

1.  Lipid layer: Most anterior of the 3 layers of the tear film Prevents
    evaporation of aqueous portion of tear film. Produced by the tarsal
    (Meibomian) glands

2.  Aqueous layer: Middle layer, comprises majority of tear film.
    Produced by main lacrimal gland (50%) and nictitating membrane gland
    (50%)

3.  Mucoid layer: Inner layer, acts as surfactant to help spread tear
    film across cornea. Produced by conjunctival goblet cells.

### Tear production

-   Main lacrimal gland - on dorsolateral surface of globe.

-   Gland of the nictitans - on ventroposterior aspect of nictitans.

### Tear drainage

-   Upper and lower nasolacrimal puncta → upper and lower canaliculi →
    both canaliculi join at the nasolacrimal sac → nasolacrimal duct →
    nasal cavity.

### Functions of tears

-   Corneal nourishment

-   Medium for sweeping debris from corneal surface

-   Lubricate corneal surface to facilitate movement of lids and
    nictitans Refractive surface

Conjunctiva
-----------

### Overview/ Gross anatomy

-   Mucous covering the inner of the lids and the anterior portion of
    the globe.

-   Bulbar conjunctiva - portion covering globe.

-   Palpebral conjunctiva - portion covering inner surface of the lids

-   Fornix (or cul-de-sac) - portion where bulbar and palpebral portions
    come together.

### Histologic anatomy

-   Stratified squamous epithelium with microvilli, coated with
    mucopolysaccharides to help stabilize tear film.

-   Goblet cells - located primarily in palpebral conjunctiva and
    fornix, secrete mucin layer of tear film. Conjunctiva associated
    lymphoid tissue (CALT)

### Functions of conjunctiva

-   Prevents corneal desiccation via secretions of goblet cells and
    blinking.

-   Prevents microbe invasion via CALT and Ab secretion (the conjunctiva
    of most domestic species normally contains high numbers of potential
    pathogens).

Nictitating Membrane (aka third eyelid)
---------------------------------------

### Overview/ Gross anatomy

-   Located in ventromedial conjunctival sac.

-   Sweeps across cornea in a dorsolateral direction; movement is
    passive, occurring when the animal retracts the globe into to
    orbital cavity.

-   Avian - located dorsomedially; movement is active and in a
    ventrolateral direction

### Histologic anatomy

-   T-shaped cartilage gives support to NM.

-   NM gland on ventroposterior aspect of nictitans, surrounds shaft of
    T-cartilage.

-   Anterior and posterior surfaces (also called palpebral and bulbar
    surfaces, respectively) of NM covered with conjunctiva.

-   Numerous lymphoid follicles located on bulbar surface.

-   Muscle not found in NM of most species; cat has some smooth muscle,
    the function of which is not clear.

### Functions of NM

-   Secretion of tears.

-   Protection of globe.

Cornea and Sclera
=================

Cornea
------

### Overview/ Gross anatomy

-   Comprises anterior 1/5 of fibrous tunic

-   Approximately 0.5-0.6 mm thick

-   Joins sclera in transitional zone called "limbus"

### Histologic anatomy

#### Epithelium

-   Anterior most layer of cornea

-   Constantly replenishing tissue (turnover approx. 7 days)

    Divided into 3 layers  
    1.  Basal cells: Caudal layer; single cell thickness; attached to
        basement membrane via hemidesmosomes. Only epithelial layer to
        undergo mitosis

    2.  Wing cells: Middle transitional layer between basal cells and
        squamous cells. 2-3 cells thick in dog

    3.  Squamous cells: Anterior layer, 2-3 cells thick in dog.

-   Microplicae and microvilli on surface help stabilize tear film

-   Tight junctions between squamous cells limit permeability
    Nonkeratinized

#### Bowman’s layer

-   Condensation of anterior stroma just beneath basal epithelium

-   Present in primates

-   Absent in most domestic species (equivocal in cows)

#### Stroma

-   90% of corneal thickness

-   Collagen and GAGs; low cellularity

-   Collagen in lamellae that span corneal diameter

-   Keratocytes - cells that are responsible for maintenance of
    collagen, can transform into fibroblasts to form scar tissue

#### Descemet’s membrane

-   Basement membrane of endothelium

#### Endothelium

-   Single layer of hexagonal cells Posterior-most layer

-   Important in maintaining state of relative dehydration of cornea

### Physiology

#### Corneal transparency

-   Devoid of blood vessels (except at limbus)

-   Nonpigmented (except at limbus)

-   Nonkeratinized surface epithelium

-   Size and organization of stromal collagen fibrils (bundles spaced at
    regular intervals)

-   Relative state of dehydration (NaKATPase pump in endothelium pumps
    water out of stroma into anterior chamber).

Sclera
------

### Overview/ Gross anatomy Posterior 4/5 of fibrous tunic

-   Composition similar to cornea, but not transparent

### Histologic anatomy

#### Intrascleral venous plexus

-   Anterior stromal veins

-   Contains small perforations through which optic nerve axon bundles
    exit eye.

Uveal Tract
===========

Overview
--------

-   Anterior uvea: iris and ciliary body

-   Posterior uvea: choroid

-   Very vascular, darkly pigmented

Iris
----

### Gross anatomy

-   Ciliary zone - peripheral half of iris

-   Pupillary zone - central half

-   Collarette - line of demarcation between pupillary and ciliary zones

-   Iris rests against anterior surface of lens

### Histologic anatomy - divided into 4 layers:

1.  Anterior border layer

2.  Stroma: Loose collagenous fibers. Contains pupillary sphincter
    muscle.

3.  Dilator muscle layer: Myoepithelial; not as strong as sphincter
    muscle

4.  Posterior epithelium: Sometimes extends axially into pupil as
    "pupillary ruff"

### Pupil

-   Hole in center of iris

-   Round in dog, vertical slit in cat, horizontal oval in horse, cow

-   Corpora nigrum (or granula iridica): spherical protuberances of
    anterior and posterior epithelial layers that extend into the pupil;
    present in ungulates.

### Vascular supply

-   Long posterior ciliary arteries: Enter iris at 3 and 9 o’clock
    positions, each then divides into dorsal and ventral branches

-   Major arterial circle: Formed by dorsal and ventral branches of
    l.p.c.a., located in peripheral iris

-   Radial arteries: From major arterial circle toward pupil

### Innervation

-   Sensory: Long posterior ciliary nerves (ultimately from ophthalmic
    br. of CN5)

-   Pupillary sphincter: Parasympathetically innervated

-   Dilator: Sympathetically innervated

### Physiology

-   Interendothelial tight junctions of iridal vasculature prevent
    macromolecules from entering aqueous humor (therefore contributes to
    "blood aqueous barrier")

-   Iris muscles controlled by autonomic nervous system

-   Pupil size controls amount of light entering eye

Ciliary body
------------

### Gross anatomy

-   Circumferential structure (i.e., doughnut shaped) posterior to iris
    Pars plana - posterior half of doughnut; flat

-   Pars plicata - anterior half of doughnut; thrown into 75-100 folds
    called ciliary processes

-   Zonules extend from processes and valleys between them to lens
    equator

### Histologic anatomy - divided into 3 layers:

-   Stroma: Adjoins sclera

    -   Three muscles: longitudinal, radial and circumferential;
        longitudinal inserts anteriorly on trabecular meshwork of
        iridocorneal angle

-   Pigmented epithelium: Overlays stroma. Continuous with dilator
    muscle layer of iris

-   Nonpigmented epithelium Overlays pigmented epithelium: Continuous
    with posterior epithelium of iris Secretes aqueous humor

### Vascular supply

-   Long posterior ciliary arteries: Branches sent posteriorly to
    ciliary body just before entering iris

-   Anterior ciliary arteries: Travel anteriorly with rectus muscles,
    pierce sclera just posterior to limbus

### Innervation

-   Sensory: Long posterior ciliary nerves

-   Ciliary muscles: Parasympathetic innervation via short posterior
    ciliary nerves

-   Ciliary epithelium: Contains sympathetic innervation, the function
    of which is unknown

### Physiology

-   Accommodation: Thickening of lens in anterior-posterior dimension
    for focusing on near objects Accomplished via contraction of
    longitudinal ciliary muscle

-   Trabecular meshwork: Iridocorneal angle structure through which
    aqueous drains. Contains small pores which enlarge when longitudinal
    ciliary muscle contracts

-   Production of aqueous humor:

    -   Diffusion

    -   Active transport

        -   Most important process in aqueous production

        -   NaKATPase located between NPE cells; Na+ pumped into
            posterior chamber, water follows

        -   Carbonic anhydrase - enzyme in NPE; necessary for aqueous
            production

    -   Ultrafiltration

        -   Movement of fluid in accordance with hydrostatic forces

-   Blood-aqueous barrier

    -   Interendothelial junctions of iris vasculature Interepithelial
        junctions of NPE

    -   Restricts entry of macromolecules (proteins, especially
        fibrinogenic proteins) into aqueous humor

Iridocorneal angle
------------------

### Overview

-   Area where iris meets cornea Aqueous humor drainage

### Structures comprising the iridocorneal angle

-   Pectinate ligaments

    -   Collagenous beams spanning from peripheral anterior iris to
        corneal endothelium Large pores

-   Trabecular meshwork

    -   Smaller pores, offers some resistance to aqueous outflow

-   Ciliary cleft

    -   Depression in anterior ciliary body where trabecular meshwork is
        located

-   Intrascleral venous plexus

    -   Shunts aqueous from angle to systemic circulation

Aqueous Humor Dynamics
----------------------

### Why have aqueous?

-   Nourishment of avascular anterior segment structures

### Aqueous flow

-   NPE of ciliary body → posterior chamber → pupil → anterior chamber →
    between pectinate ligaments → through trabecular meshwork → into
    intrascleral venous plexus → into systemic circulation

### Aqueous production

-   See "Ciliary Body - Physiology"

### Aqueous drainage

-   Facility of outflow

    -   Ease with which aqueous humor escapes

-   Conventional outflow

    -   Outflow via trabecular meshwork and intrascleral venous plexus
        described above

-   Unconventional (aka uveoscleral) outflow

    -   Some fluid will bypass meshwork to be absorbed directly into
        anterior ciliary body → supraciliary space → systemic
        circulation. Minor pathway in dog, cat, major pathway in horse

### Establishment and maintenance of intraocular pressure

-   Outflow resistance

    -   Primarily at trabecular meshwork and intrascleral venous plexus

-   Maintaining "normal" IOP

    -   Balance between production and drainage of aqueous humor

Choroid
-------

### Gross anatomy

-   Posterior 2/3 of uvea

-   Anterior choroidal margin meets posterior aspect of ciliary body
    stroma Very vascular, darkly pigmented

### Histologic anatomy - divided into 3 layers:

-   Suprachoroidea

    -   Potential space between choroidal stroma and sclera Long
        posterior ciliary arteries and nerves reside here Site of
        unconventional aqueous humor outflow

-   Stroma

    -   Large vessel layer (posterior)

    -   Intermediate vessel layer (anterior)

        -   Tapetum: Highly reflective layer to aid nocturnal vision.
            Triangular on frontal view, located dorsally.

-   Choriocapillaris

    -   Single layer of capillaries between anterior stroma and retinal
        pigmented epithelium

### Physiology

-   Choriocapillaris supplies nutrition to outer half of retina

Lens
====

Overview
--------

-   Accommodation in near vision (relatively poorly developed in
    domestic species)

Gross anatomy
-------------

-   Anterior and posterior poles

-   Equator

-   Ciliary zonules (suspensory ligaments) from equator to ciliary body

Histologic anatomy
------------------

### Capsules

-   Anterior and posterior; basement membrane of epithelium

-   Posterior epithelium only present in utero, so posterior capsule
    very thin; anterior capsule thickens throughout life

### Epithelium

-   Postnatally only present anteriorly and at equator Equatorial
    epithelial cells elongate to form lens fibers

### Cortex Outermost fibers

-   Y-sutures; visible lines where lens fibers come together

### Nucleus Innermost fibers

-   Subdivided into embryonal, fetal and adult nuclei

"Geographic anatomy"
--------------------

-   Axial (aka polar) vs. equatorial

-   Terms used to describe location of lens opacities

Physiology
----------

### Protein content

-   Highest concentration of protein in body (approx. 35%)

### Na+ pump

-   Found in lens fiber membranes and epithelium Maintains low
    intralenticular water content

### Glucose metabolism - glucose readily enters lens

-   Glycolysis

    -   Responsible for 80% of glucose metabolism

    -   Initial enzyme: hexokinase; saturated at glucose concentration
        of 200 mg/dl

-   TCA cycle

    -   5%

-   Pentose monophosphate shunt

    -   15%

-   Sorbitol pathway

    -   Usually negligible, utilization increases when hexokinase
        saturated

    -   End product is fructose, which can’t escape lens

### Glutathione and sulfhydryl proteins

-   Maintained in reduced form - prevents abnormal cross linking of
    proteins and subsequent opacification

### Production of lens fibers

-   Equatorial epithelial cells

-   Fibers meet in Y-sutures

### Accommodation

-   Contraction of ciliary body muscles → loosening of ciliary zonules →
    lens assumes more spherical shape (i.e., thickens in
    anterior-posterior dimension) → brings near objects into focus.

### Maintenance of transparency

-   High concentration of crystalline proteins

-   Few intracellular organelles

-   Very little interfibrillar water

-   Fibers densely packed

-   Avascular

-   Nonpigmented

Vitreous
========

-----------------------

-   Occupies 75-80% of volume of eye

-   Transparent, avascular, low cellularity Gel-like consistency

Histologic anatomy
------------------

    artery regresses within a few weeks of birth in most species)

-   Primary vitreous: Immediately surrounding Cloquet’s canal Secondary
    vitreous: Majority of vitreous body

-   Tertiary vitreous: Synonymous with ciliary zonules

Physiology
----------

-   98% water suspended in hyaluronic acid and collagen matrix

-   Often liquefies in response to posterior segment disease

Retina
======

Overview
--------

-   Purpose: Transforms electromagnetic radiation (i.e., visible light)
    into an electrochemical signal that can be interpreted by the brain

Gross anatomy
-------------

Ora Ciliaris Retinae (ora serrata in primates)  
Junction of anterior retina and posterior ciliary body

Neurosensory retina  
-   Innermost 90% of retina

-   Peripherally, continues anteriorly as nonpigmented ciliary body
    epithelium

Retinal pigmented epithelium  
-   Peripherally, continues anteriorly as pigmented ciliary body
    epithelium

Area centralis  
Central visual area

Histologic anatomy
------------------

### Classically divided into 10 layers (see Fig 15-1, p. 415 in Severin ).

1.  Retinal pigmented epithelium

2.  Photoreceptors

3.  External limiting membrane

4.  Outer nuclear layer

5.  Outer plexiform layer

6.  Inner nuclear layer (includes bipolar cells)

7.  Inner plexiform layer

8.  Ganglion cell layer

9.  Nerve fiber layer

10. Internal limiting membrane

### Three neuron chain in neurosensory retina transduces photic signal into electrochemical signal and sends to brain

1.  Photoreceptors

    -   Rods - very sensitive; dim light vision

    -   Cones - bright light vision, color vision, most acute vision

    -   Rod outer segment: Thousands of membranous discs stacked like
        pancakes; rhodopsin embedded in membranes

    -   Rods out number cones 100:1 in peripheral retina, 10:1 in area
        centralis

2.  Bipolar cell

    -   Transfers potential generated in photoreceptor to ganglion cell

3.  Ganglion cell

    -   Axons of ganglion cells make up optic nerve

    -   Transfers potential from bipolar cells to midbrain (for
        pupillary light responses) and visual cortex

### RPE

-   Single cell layer between neurosensory retina and choriocapillaris

-   Important supporting role for photoreceptors

-   Nonpigmented dorsally to expose tapetum

### Müeller cell

-   Retinal "support" cell that spans from RPE to internal limiting
    membrane

Vascular supply
---------------

Inner half of retina  
Retinal vessels located in nerve fiber layer

Outer half of retina  
Choriocapillaris

Short posterior ciliary arteries  
9-12 arteries that pierce the sclera around the optic nerve to become
retinal vessels

### Various vascular patterns seen in domestic animals:

-   Holangiotic - all quadrants, from peripapillary to periphery,
    supplied with retinal vessels (dog, cat)

-   Merangiotic - only selected sectors of retina supplied with vessels
    (rabbit)

-   Paurangiotic - vessels in all quadrants, but only in vicinity of
    optic disc (horse)

-   Anangiotic - no retinal vessels (avian)

Physiology of neurosensory retina (will use rod as example)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Similarity to other sensory systems  
Receptor cell, 3 neuron chain to brain

Electrical state of PR cell in dark  
-   Relatively depolarized (approximately - 30 mV, vs. - 70 mV found in
    most excitable cells) due to outer segment permeability to Na+

-   Inner segment NaKATPase pump removes Na+ from cell

-   Inhibitory neurotransmitter between photoreceptor and bipolar cell
    continuously released in dark

### Transduction

-   Rhodopsin

    -   Photopigment composed of the protein opsin and 11-cis retinal

    -   Photon causes configurational change that results in closure of
        outer segment Na+

    -   channels and, therefore, hyperpolarization

-   Hyperpolarization

    -   Causes cessation of release of inhibitory neurotransmitter
        Bipolar cell therefore "switched on"

### PR-bipolar interaction

-   Removal of inhibitory neurotransmitter creates typical depolarizing
    potential in bipolar cell

### Bipolar-ganglion cell interaction

-   Typical depolarization

Optic Nerve

-   Collection of axons of ganglion cells

-   Lamina cribrosa - Scleral structure through which axons exit the
    globe

Location in fundus
------------------

-   Just ventral to geometric axis in most species

-   Dog: may be in tapetal area, in non-tapetal area, or at
    tapetal/non-tapetal junction, depending on size of tapetum

Myelination
-----------

-   Dog: myelination of ganglion cell axons extends for 1-2 mm into
    retina (i.e., disc is myelinated)

-   Other species: disc not myelinated.

Physiologic cup or pit
----------------------

-   Small depression in center of canine disc Represents posterior turn
    of ganglion cell axons

-   Dog: 70%

Optic tracts
------------

-   Between chiasm and brain

Destinations of optic nerve
---------------------------

-   Midbrain - for pupillary light responses
