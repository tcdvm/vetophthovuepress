## Recent updates
05/2022
- Updated the [conjunctiva/third eyelid section](conjunctiva/conjunctiva.html)! Lots of pictures, descriptions of procedures (esp cherry eye). Doesn't have as much information as I think is possible but just trying to get through each section as best I can and then maybe go back with additional pictures/techniques/videos/peer-reviewed information. Next one is a biggie - ***cornea***. Obviously that will be fairly involved and probably the one with the most information as it's probably the most commonly dealt with part of the eye in clinical practice. Hopefully will get it done before the end of the year!

11/2021
- Long overdue update! Been working on the KCS chapter. Added some text, images, etc. KCS is a really common thing to encounter in practice and so it's one of the more important topics to master in veterinary ophthalmology. Hopefully there will be some useful information here. Any comments or corrections (minor grammar things, spelling, whatever) welcome (tchendvm @ gmail . com)

04/2021
- New additions to the [Poetry Page](artcorner/poetry.html) of the Art Corner!! Thank you to Dr. Godwin for the lovely contribution inspired by [ectropion](eyelids/eyelids.html#ectropion). Also added some graphics to the poetry. Still open for submissions! Email tchendvm@gmail.com. Stay stafe.

03/2021
- A year since the pandemic started. Time flies! Hope everyone is staying healthy and getting vaccinated!
- Edited Eyelids some more, including a neat interface that allows for "revealing" an image with questions and answers. See below for an example of that:

<TwentyTwenty
  before="/eyelids/media/images/EyelidAgenesisRight.png"
  after="/eyelids/media/images/EyelidAgenesisLeft.png"
  offset="0.05"/>

- Added an "Art Corner" after a first submission by Dr. Trevor Arnold - check out his haiku, also added a place ophtho memes because why not? The Art Corner is open for submissions! Please email Dr. Chen at tchendvm@gmail.com to submit your work. Peer review is limited and you can put it on your CV/resume!

01/2020
- Happy New Year!
- Added a new project I'v been working on - the Ophtho Medications Grid
	- Allows searching for medications
	- Filtering based on drug class, disease for use, and cost
	- Contains info on dosing frequency, mechanism of action, and warnings
- Also edited some stuff in Eyelids
- Will continue working on things hopefully in the new year!

03/2020
- Whoa, hello COVID-19! Now that you're here and I can't go to work and the economy is dying, it's time to focus on things that matter! Fonts! Changed the site-wide font, I think it looks prettier.
- More updates to follow since I'm finding myself with all this free time.

03/2020
- Happy New Year!
- Still working on this thing (slow but sure)
- Added "Lab handouts" in Clinics per Dr. Cherry's request
- Added **a lot** more content to [Orbit](orbit/orbit.html) - it was originally in kind of an "outline" form and I want it to be more like "text" form. There's some outlines for treatment but a lot more explanatory material which I personally find more easier to read. I'd like to continue the same edits to the other parts here in the future (eyelids, cornea, etc.).
 - Included "footnotes" and "references" to [Orbit](orbit/orbit.html) - yay evidence-based medicine!
- New feature - "Details" where you can click on the arrow head for more information if you're curious (see example below):
::: detail Click me!
Hello! See here for "gee whiz" information or extra desired info that is not included in the main body or text.
:::
- New feature - "Hover for details" for pictures - another space-saving feature that will give more details for images as figures; if looking on a phone or something, the caption will just be expanded vertically (see example below):
<figure>
  <img src="./example.jpg" alt="Example Picture" style="width:100%">
		<figcaption>
		<b>Cats are better than dogs (Hover your mouse over this image for details)</b>
		<p>
    Because of the following important reasons:
			<ul>
			<li>They are quieter</li>	
			<li>They are cuter</li>	
			<li>They don't have to be taken outside to do their "business" :hankey: </li>	
			<li>Their eyes are prettier</li>	
			</ul> 
		</p>
	</figcaption>
</figure>
- That's it! More content and changes to follow. If there are any suggestions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me (tchendvm@gmail.com). Thanks for visiting!
