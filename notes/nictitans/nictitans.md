Anatomy
=======

1.  Conjunctiva: lines both sides of the third eyelid

2.  Cartilage: T-shaped with the base towards the medial fornix and the
    top along the leading edge. This cartilage stops the nictitans from
    buckling.

3.  A lacrimal gland is present on the bulbar side of the nictitans

Functions
=========

1.  Protection of the cornea

2.  Production of 35% of the aqueous part of the tear film

3.  Reticuloendothelial activity

Cherry eye
==========

Prolapse of the gland of the nictitans towards the leading edge of the
nictitans. It is suspected that the ligamentous structure that normally
holds the gland in place is weak. Cocker Spaniels and bulldogs are
predisposed.

-   Treatment:

-   The two most commonly used ways to treat this are:

    -   Pocket Technique: Easier to do. An incision is made on either
        side of the gland and the conjunctiva is sutured over the top of
        the gland.

    -   Tack down method: More difficult when first learning. The gland
        is tacked to the periosteum of the orbital rim.
