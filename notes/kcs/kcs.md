# Lacrimal System and KCS

## Tear Composition

### Three components of the tear film

1.  Mucous - helps the aqueous part of the tears adhere to the cornea and acts as a surfactant to help them spread across the cornea, traps bacteria and particulate matter. Produced by goblet cells located primarily in the fornix of the conjunctiva.
2.  Aqueous – composes the majority of tear film. Maintains an optically uniform corneal surface, helps remove foreign matter from the corneal surface, aids in lubrication, and provides nutrients to the avascular cornea. Produced by the lacrimal gland located just posterior to the dorsal, lateral orbital rim (65%) and by the gland of the third eyelid (35%).
3.  Lipids - prevent evaporation of the aqueous layer and prevents spillage of the tears over the eyelid margin. Produced by the meibomian glands in the eyelid margin.

## Definition of KCS

A deficiency in tear production of the severity that the health of the eye is compromised. Most often is a result of a deficiency of the aqueous layer.

### Clinical Signs

1.  Hyperemic conjunctiva
2.  Mucopurulent discharge - secondary to bacterial infection and the mucous builds up
3.  Keratitis - pigment, corneal vascularization, keratinization, ulceration, perforation
4.  Dull appearing cornea sometimes with severe blepharospasm

KCS is the single most common cause of “conjunctivitis” in dogs and can lead to blindness!

### Diagnosis

-   Clinical signs
-   Schirmer Tear Test
    -   Normal: 15-25mm/min
    -   Subnormal: 0-10 mm/min
    -   “Gray Zone”: 10-14 mm/min
    -   If the tear production is in the gray zone then go by the clinical signs or recheck in a couple of weeks.
-   Qualitative tear film deficiency can cause signs similar to qualitative tear film deficiency but occurs when there is either too little lipid or mucous.

### Differential Etiologies

1.  Immune-mediated (autoimmune adenitis) - most common cause of KCS in dogs.
    -   Diagnosis
        -   Breed predisposition (Cockers, Bulldogs, Lhasa Apso and many others)
        -   No other cause found.
2.  Canine Distemper Virus and Feline Herpes Virus
3.  Toxic - sulfa drugs, etogesic (most cases have permanent KCS)
4.  Topical - atropine - temporary
5.  General anesthesia – temporary, but can last longer than 24 hours
6.  Neurogenic - facial nerve palsy, trigeminal nerve palsy
7.  Iatrogenic - removal of the nictitans gland. It used to be standard practice to remove the gland of the nictitans when a dog developed prolapsed gland of the nictitans (cherry eye). Now the gland is replaced.
8.  Chronic conjunctivitis - inflammation and scarring
9.  Lacrimal gland agenesis – rare but usually unilateral in very small breeds
10. Radiation therapy – when the eye is in the field.
11. Hypothyroidism may be associated with KCS

Treatment

Medical
-------

1.  Replace the tears - artificial tear ointment

    -   Multiple tear replacers are available on the market. Artificial
        tear solution has such a brief contact time that it is rarely
        beneficial in veterinary medicine. High viscosity polymers help
        in corneal wetting and prevention of evaporation but they can be
        quite expensive. Artificial tear ointments with a petrolatum
        base are less expensive and have excellent contact time.
        Depending on the tear production, may use as often as every 4
        hours. Genteal, which is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, lasts
        almost as long as the hydrocarbon-based ointment products, but
        is less “slimy” and appears to be a little more comforting than
        the ointments. In mild cases of lagophthalmia artificial tears
        alone may keep the keratitis in check.

2.  Create more tears - Cyclosporine A

    -   Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant that suppresses T-helper
        cell activity by suppressing IL-2. It may also work by blocking
        prolactin receptors on gland.

    -   Cyclosporine A is manufactured as an ointment, Optimmune®, also
        is compounded as a 2% solution in corn oil or olive oil. Is used
        BID. Works in approximately 75% of cases. May take as long as 8
        weeks to kick in. Usually if it is going to work, it will in 1-2
        weeks but give it as long as 3 months before giving up on it.
        Once tear production is back up, may consider discontinuing or
        decreasing frequency of artificial tears. LIFE LONG treatment in
        most cases. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive that is closely
        related to cyclosporine. One large clinical study showed that
        some dogs that fail to respond to cyclosporine will respond to
        tacrolimus. At this point tacrolimus is not labeled for ocular
        use, but can be compounded into eye drops. Both drugs appear to
        help with the keratitis even when the tear production does not
        increase.

3.  Topical antibiotics Tears help prevent infection so secondary
    bacterial conjunctivitis commonly develops with KCS. Also if corneal
    ulceration is present, antibiotics should be used prophylactically
    to prevent infection. Triple antibiotic (neomycin, polymyxin,
    bacitracin) is the first choice as it has a broad spectrum of
    activity. For treatment of conjunctivitis +/- a superficial
    uncomplicated ulcer use TID to QID.

4.  Topical corticosteroids Occasionally the conjunctivitis is severe so
    that even if the tears are made, they cannot get down the duct.
    Steroids can be helpful - make sure to rule out corneal ulceration
    first. Can use a steroid such as ophthalmic dexamethasone. I
    generally only use this after I have tried cyclosporine,
    antibiotics, and artificial tear ointment first to no avail.
    Steroids may also help jump start the resolution of the keratitis.

5.  Pilocarpine - parasympathomimetic drug Increases tear production by
    stimulating the parasympathetic innervation in the nasolacrimal
    gland. Dose is 2 drops of 2% pilocarpine 2 times per day per 20 lbs.
    This is only effective for the rare neurogenic KCS.

Surgical
--------

Parotid duct transposition. A last resort to restore corneal moisture
when all else has failed. Surgery is pretty much what it sounds like.
Surgery is a bit tedious, so this is one of the few ocular surgeries
that we generally recommend referring. Potential complications: overflow
of moisture onto the face, corneal mineralization, fibrosis of the duct,
poor salivary secretions, and sialolith formation.

Emergency corneal stabilization: Conjunctival grafting in the case of
very deep ulcers, desmetoceles, perforations. With a deep ulcer one
cannot wait for the tear production to increase.
