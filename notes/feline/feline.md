Conjunctivitis
==============

-   The primary manifestation of conjunctival disease in cats is
    conjunctivitis.

-   The big three:

    -   Herpes

    -   Chlamydia

    -   Mycoplasma

-   Age:

    -   Neonates and juveniles

-   Generalities that may help distinguish among them:

    -   Herpes - Often accompanied by URT disease

    -   Chlamydia - More likely to produce whopping chemosis

    -   Mycoplasma - Occasionally produces a pseudo-diphtheritic
        membrane on surface of conjunctiva.

-   Latency and recrudescence:

    -   Herpes latent in trigeminal, perhaps cornea. Recrudesces when
        stresseds.

    -   Secondary infections frequently manifest as keratitis.

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Cytology of conjunctival scrapings

    -   PCR test of conjunctival scrapings (esp. Herpes and chlamydia).

    -   Very common NOT to arrive at a definitive diagnosis, so you end
        up treating empirically.

-   Treatment:

    -   Herpes – Herpetic conjunctivitis is usually self-limiting. May
        need specific antiviral therapy in extremely refractory cases
        (will discuss antivirals in detail under “Herpetic Keratitis”).

    -   Chlamydia - Topical tetracycline or chloramphenicol

    -   Mycoplasma - Topical tetracycline or chloramphenicol

Keratitis
=========

Herpetic keratitis
------------------

-   Clinical signs / history

    -   Usually manifests in adults following initial URT illness and
        conjunctivitis as a kitten

    -   Recall that this virus remains latent in the trigeminal ganglion
        and, to a lesser extent, the corneal stroma

    -   Keratitis

    -   Dendritic ulceration

    -   Generally have concurrent conjunctivitis

    -   Frequently have decreased STT as well.

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Dendritic ulceration is pathognomonic

    -   History of URT disease in cat with keratitis should always
        arouse suspicion of herpes

    -   PCR test of conjunctival swab

-   Treatment:

    -   Antiviral drugs

        -   Trifluorothymidine (topical) - Solution only, so frequent
            therapy, but 95% effective. Very expensive

        -   Cidofovir (topical) – Concentrates in corneal epithelium, so
            can get away with BID therapy

        -   Famciclovir (oral) – The most in vogue therapy in 2015, but
            very expensive. I’m not convinced the literature is
            conclusive that it’s any better than topical cidofovir

        -   All are nucleic acid analogues, result in creation of
            proteins that virus can’t use, and ultimately virus fails to
            replicate (thus they are virostatic).

        -   All capable of inducing intense chemosis due to sensitivity
            to drugs.

    -   Topical antibiotics (tetracycline)

    -   Oral lysine – May reduce the frequency and severity of
        recrudescences

    -   +/- Topical atropine

-   Prognosis:

    -   Response to antivirals is pretty good, but recurrence is very
        common.

    -   Need to warn owners of this possibility

Feline corneal sequestrum (nigrum)
----------------------------------

-   Maxim: If it’s a cornea, and it’s black, and it’s a cat, its a
    SEQUESTRUM!!

-   Definition: Area of focal corneal stromal necrosis in center of
    cornea. Only seen in cats, with some predisposition for
    brachycephalics.

-   Etiology:

    -   Unknown; possible relationship to tear film abnormalities,
        decreased corneal sensitivity, herpesvirus infection, chronic
        corneal trauma.

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical appearance.

-   Treatment:

    -   Aggressive - Lamellar keratectomy, followed by NM flap.
        Subsequently treat as ulcer. Usually choose this tx if painful.

    -   Conservative - Most sequestra will slough spontaneously given
        enough time (months).

Eosinophilic Keratitis
----------------------------------

-   Keratitis syndrome of pinkish fleshy proliferation at limbus, unkown etiology, diagnose by cytology, resonds to steroids.

Exposure Keratitis due to Eyelid Agenesis (also called Eyelid Coloboma)
----------------------------------

-   Definition: Congential absence of portion of lid, usually superotemporal.

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Keratitis changes
    -   Blepharospasm
    -   Portion of lid, usually superotemporal, absent

-   Treatment:
    -   Medical - Topical lubricants
    -   Surgical - Tarsal pedicle graft

Anterior Uveitis
================

-   Definition: Inflammation of iris and ciliary body.

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Same as for dog

    -   Flare, miosis, hyperemia, fibrin, etc.

    -   Cats somewhat more prone to development of pre-iridial
        fibrovascular membranes (PIFMs) in anterior chamber.

    -   As with dogs, anterior uveitis in cats is sometimes associated
        with systemic disease, so you may have clinical signs / history
        referable to such disease.

    -   Lens induced uveitis uncommon in cats.

-   Etiology:

    -   Systemic infectious disease (toxo, FIP, systemic fungal, FeLV,
        FIV)

    -   Intraocular neoplasia (melanoma, lymphoma)

    -   Idiopathic (about 70%)

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical signs

    -   Good physical exam to delineate systemic illness

    -   Minimum data base (CBC, profile, FIV, FeLV, toxo)

-   Treatment:

    -   Treat any underlying disorder

    -   Topical steroids, atropine

    -   Oral aspirin (1/2 baby twice weekly) for chronic cases

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   High incidence of secondary glaucoma.

Ocular Neoplasia
================

-   Lid Tumors

    -   Squamous cell carcinoma

        -   Clinical signs / history:

            -   Usually older, white cats.

            -   Pinkish mass, sometimes ulcerated, of lids (can also see
                on NM, conjunctiva, cornea)

    -   Treatment:

        -   Surgical resection; due to the infinite varieties of tumor
            location and size, there is no single “preferred technique.”
            Often involve rotational skin grafts.

        -   Brachytherapy (i.e., intralesional radiation)

        -   Cryotherapy

-   Intraocular tumors

    -   Anterior Uveal Melanoma

        -   Most common primary intraocular tumor of cats. Iris affected
            more commonly than ciliary body.

        -   Clinical signs / history:

            -   Diffuse form - Most common in cats. Rather than a
                discrete tumor mass, animal presents for
                hyperpigmentation of iris.

                -   Sometimes present primarily with signs of anterior
                    uveitis.

            -   Nodular form - Discrete black nodule.

        -   Benign or malignant? - There definitely is malignant
            potential. Difficult to say for sure about a benign form.
            Some say there is a benign “variant” termed melanocytoma or
            diffuse benign iris melanosis. Others say these supposedly
            benign pigmentary disorders have malignant potential, while
            still others say they are always pre-malignant.

        -   Metastatic potential - Considered high (50-ish%) to regional
            lymph nodes then viscera. Can be long delay between
            diagnosis of ocular tumor and metastatic disease.

        -   Secondary glaucoma common.

        -   Diagnosis:

            -   Tentatively diagnosed based on clinical appearance
                alone; definitive diagnosis made on histopathology of
                enucleated globe.

        -   Treatment:

            -   One opinion - Observation, then enucleate if secondary
                glaucoma or ocular pain occur.

                -   Another opinion - Early enucleation

    -   Lymphosarcoma of the Iris

        -   Clinical signs / history:

            -   Tan-pink mass in anterior chamber

            -   Ocular pain if uveitis is present

            -   Secondary glaucoma common.

        -   Etiology:

            -   Since there’s no lymphatic tissue in the eye, this
                should always be considered a secondary tumor.

        -   Diagnosis:

            -   Clinical appearance, while not as classic as the
                melanoma, is still quite suggestive.

            -   If mass is large enough can aspirate via the limbus.

        -   Treatment:

            -   Search for primary tumor site.

            -   Enucleation.

    -   Feline Post-traumatic Ocular Sarcoma

        -   Definition: Intraocular sarcoma (fibro-, anaplastic, or
            osteo-) that can seemingly arise diffusely within the globe
            following traumatic insults, and perhaps even following
            chronic anterior uveitis.

        -   Clinical signs / history:

            -   Trauma

            -   Usually older cats

            -   Usually do not see a discrete mass; present with
                glaucoma, phthisis, or signs of chronic inflammation.
                Therefore diagnosis is often made on histopathologic
                exam of enucleated globe.

        -   Treatment:

            -   Enucleation due to aggressive nature of tumor.

            -   Often fatal
