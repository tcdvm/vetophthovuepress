Keratitis
=========

Mycotic Keratitis
-----------------

-   Definition:

    -   Inflammation of the cornea due to infection with fungal
        organisms. Almost exclusively a disease of horses.

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Usually slowly progressive course.

    -   Typical keratitis lesions of edema, cellular infiltrate,
        neovascularization.

    -   Ulceration common.

    -   White stromal infiltration – organisms, leukocytes

    -   Superficial plaques

    -   Sometimes see keratomalacia

    -   Sometimes see stromal abscessation (see below)

    -   Secondary uveitis is a major problem

-   Etiology:

    -   Generally filamentous fungi

    -   Fusarium, Aspergillus common

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Corneal scraping for cytology

    -   Culture and sensitivity; limitations of culture can be expense,
        turnaround time, and puacity of available antifungal agents; but
        these problems are improving

-   Treatment:

    -   Topical antifungals

        -   Miconazole

        -   Vericonazole

        -   Natamycin

        -   Amphoterecin B

    -   Intraocular miconazole on very rare occasions – very toxic
        intraocularly!!

    -   Topical antibiotics

    -   Topical atropine

    -   Oral NSAIDs – phenylbutazone or flunixin

    -   STRINGENTLY AVOID STEROIDS!

    -   Keratectomy with pedicle graft for deep lesions that are
        progressing, and for stromal abscess

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   Always grave prognosis

    -   May progress to fungal endophthalmitis – may require intraocular
        miconazole but usually necessitates enucleation

    -   Prolonged clinical course (weeks to months)

    -   Corneal scarring

Corneal Stromal Abscess
=======================

-   Definition:

    -   Accumulation of leukocytes, and usually infectious organisms
        (bacterial or fungal) beneath an intact corneal epithelium.
        Primarily a disease of horses.

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Sometimes history of trauma

    -   Focal white-yellow infiltrate with accompanying keratitis

    -   Fluorescein negative, or at most pinpoint-focal uptake

    -   Secondary axon reflex uveitis

-   Etiology:

    -   Usually initiated by trauma

    -   Infection sealed up by epithelium

    -   Organisms can be bacterial (usually Staph or Strep) or fungal

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Cytology and C & S of corneal lesion following epithelial
        debridement; but frequently get negative results due to depth of
        organisms.

    -   May need surgical therapy (see below) to obtain proper
        diagnostic specimens

-   Treatment:

    -   Medical

        -   Topical antibiotics (based on C &S) and atropine.
            Chloramphenicol often makes excellent empirical choice due
            to its superior corneal epithelial penetrability

        -   Periodic epithelial debridement may be necessary to improve
            penetration of antibiotics.

        -   Control secondary uveitis with oral NSAIDs

    -   Surgical

        -   Superficial keratectomy (obtain cytology, C & S)

        -   Pedicle graft

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   Prognosis for bacterial abscess better than for fungal keratitis
        or fungal abscess

    -   Corneal scarring

Infectious Bovine Keratoconjunctivitis (IBK; also called “Pinkeye”)
===================================================================

-   Definition:

    -   Inflammation of cornea and conjunctiva of cows due to bacterial
        infection, usually with Moraxella bovis

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Corneal lesions are centrally located

    -   White infiltrate with accompanying keratitis

    -   Often have ulceration, may progress to keratomalacia and
        perforation

-   Etiology:

    -   Moraxella bovis

    -   Spread by face flies

    -   UV radiation, concurrent IBR infection aggravate condition

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical diagnosis based on clinical signs; almost never attempt
        culture clinically

-   Treatment:

    -   Topical and/or subconjunctival antibiotics (gentacin,
        penicillin)

    -   Topical and/or subconjunctival steroids (can get away with
        because its a cow)

    -   NM flap for deep ulcer perforation (recall NM flap not
        appropriate therapy in dog)

    -   Intramuscular tetracycline (LA200 2 injections at 72 hour
        intervals)

    -   Vaccination results mixed and generally disappointing

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   Most will heal, even without therapy

    -   Cause tremendous monetary losses

Uveitis
=======

Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU; also called Periodic Ophthalmia, “Moon Blindness”)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Definition:

    -   Inflammation of iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina in
        horses that tends to recur periodically

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Owner notices red, watery eye

    -   Signs of anterior uveitis (flare, miosis, etc.)

    -   Be aware that this causes chorioretinitis, and sometimes retinal
        detachment, as well as anterior uveitis

    -   Recurrent bouts at unpredictable intervals

    -   Horses very prone to develop cataracts secondary to chronic
        uveitis

    -   Secondary glaucoma uncommon due to high degree of unconventional
        outflow in this species

-   Etiology:

    -   Much unknown about pathogenesis

    -   Strong evidence that infectious agents involved, but via immune
        mechanism

    -   Most common candidate organism is leptospira

    -   Initial infection → inflammation plus recruitment of anamnestic
        lymphocytes to uveal tissue OU → next exposure to organism
        results in heightened inflammatory response

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical signs and history

    -   May consider lepto titers in epidemics

-   Treatment:

    -   Topical steroids and atropine

    -   Systemic NSAIDs

    -   Current research is into vaccination as prevention of flare-ups

    -   Best long term therapy: delayed release cyclosporine surgical
        implant

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   Not difficult to control individual flare-ups, but more and more
        permanent damage is done with each one. If enough flare-ups,
        will probably go blind due to cataract or retinal degeneration.

Ocular Tumors
=============

Squamous Cell Carcinoma
-----------------------

-   Definition:

    -   Tumor of ocular epithelia in horses, cows

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Usually pink, proliferative lesion

    -   Sometimes ulcerative

    -   Lids, NM, conjunctiva, cornea

-   Etiology:

    -   Papillomavirus

    -   UV radiation

    -   Progresses through stages: plaque → papillomatous lesion →
        carcinoma in situ → invasive SCC

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical appearance pretty suggestive, but should biopsy since
        granulation tissue could look similar

-   Treatment:

    -   Surgical excision…not a good choice as sole therapy, but
        excellent in conjunction with adjunctive therapies, including

        -   Strontium plesiotherapy

        -   Cryotherapy

        -   Hyperthermia

        -   Brachytherapy (can’t use on corneal lesions)

        -   CO2 laser

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   Good prognosis if caught early.

    -   Recurrence rate is high (30%), but if retreat when recurrence
        first appears can usually cure.

    -   Does not tend to metastasize quickly

Sarcoid
-------

-   Definition:

    -   Fibroblastic dermal tumor of horses

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Verrucous (i.e., warty) or fibroblastic (i.e., like proud flesh)

    -   Fibroblastic types can be quite large and are prone to
        ulceration

-   Etiology:

    -   Good evidence for a viral etiology

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical appearance or biopsy

    -   Some say that verrucous types may transform to fibroblastic type
        in response to surgery, and therefore warn against biopsy

-   Treatment:

    -   Verrucous - leave alone; usually static and cause no problems

    -   Fibroblastic

        -   Intralesional cisplatin

        -   Intralesional BCG

        -   Brachytherapy

        -   Cryotherapy

    -   Surgery usually unrewarding because postoperative wound usually
        too large for the amount of skin available for closure, and
        because recurrence rate is high

-   Sequelae / prognosis:

    -   Never been reported to metastasize, but can be locally
        aggressive
