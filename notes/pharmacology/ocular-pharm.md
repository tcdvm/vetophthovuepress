Ophthalmic medications
======================

-   Solutions: Safer if ocular integrity is questionable. Short contact
    time.

-   Ointments: Cause severe uveitis if they enter the globe. Longer
    contact time.

Pharmacology
============

-   When possible choose antibiotic based on culture and sensitivity.

-   While waiting on C and S try to base drug choice on cytology.

-   Topical formulations can be made from IV preparations.

-   Sometimes a stronger concentration may be desired than that
    available commercially, and fortified concentrations can be made.

-   Oral antibiotics are indicated with perforation or impending
    perforation, eyelid disease, nasolacrimal disease, and vitreal
    infections (rare)

Antibiotics
===========

-   Triple antibiotic contains neomycin, polymixin B and bacitracin (or
    gramicidin). This is used for routine prophylaxis.

    -   Neomycin

        -   Aminoglycoside

        -   Bactericidal for many gram positive and gram negative
            organisms

    -   Bacitracin or Gramicidin

        -   Primarily is bactericidal against gram positive organisms

        -   Resistance is rare

    -   Polymixin B

        -   Bactericidal against gram negative organisms

        -   Development of resistance is unlikely

-   Aminoglycosides

    -   Basic spectrum is gram negative

    -   Gentamicin, tobramycin

-   Chloramphenicol

    -   Basic spectrum is gram positives, some gram negatives,
        mycoplasma, Rickettsial NOT Pseudomonas

    -   Penetrates the intact epithelium better than most antibiotics

    -   Beware of public health significance

-   Cephalosporins

    -   Gram positive and gram negative spectrum

    -   Gram positive spectrum decreases and the gram negative spectrum
        increases with increasing generations

    -   Low efficacy against Pseudomonas

-   Ciprofloxacin (and other fluoroquinolones)

    -   Broad gram-negative and gram-positive spectrum, Mycoplasma and
        Chlamydophila Should be reserved for \* severe infection, should
        not be used for prophylaxis Penetrates the intact epithelium
        better than \* most antibiotics

-   Oxytetracycline

    -   Clinical relevant spectrum of activity is narrow: rickettsial
        organisms, Mycoplasma spp., \* Chlamydophila spp., and Moraxella
        spp.

    -   Inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)

    -   Anti-poptotic and anti-inflammatory effects

    -   May hasten healing of indolent ulcers

Anticollagenase agent
=====================

-   Serum

    -   Contains macroglobulins and other substances that decrease
        matrix metalloproteinase activity and increase epithelial
        healing.

    -   Let blood clot, centrifuge, draw off the serum. Keep it sterile
        and refrigerated. Good for 1-2 weeks. If it gets cloudy or
        contaminated discard. Bacteria proliferate in serum and infected
        serum would not help the ulcer heal!!!

Cross-linked hyaluronan (Remend)
================================

-   May accelerate resolution of corneal ulcers

-   May encourage a more normal epithelial architecture

Parasympatholytic drugs
=======================

-   Atropine

    -   1% ophthalmic solution and 1% ophthalmic ointment (solution is
        bitter tasting)

    -   Onset of action 1-2 hours in normal eyes

    -   Duration of action several days to several weeks in normal eyes

    -   When uveitis is present, it will take longer for the drug to act
        and it will have shorter duration. Often use QID when starting
        therapy.

    -   Action: Paralyzes ciliary muscle and iris sphincter muscle;
        therefore, decreases pain and dilates pupil, respectively.

    -   Avoid when glaucoma is present.

    -   Normal tear production is controlled primarily by the
        parasympathetic nervous system; therefore, one can get decreased
        tear production with use of atropine.

-   Tropicamide

    -   1% ophthalmic solution

    -   Routinely used for ophthalmic examinations

    -   Onset 10-20 minutes in normal eyes

    -   Duration 6-12 hours in normal eyes

    -   May not work in eyes with uveitis because it is relatively weak
        compared to atropine Can be used more safely than atropine when
        glaucoma is suspected
