Functional Anatomy of the Orbit
===============================

-   What’s back there?

    -   Fat, muscles, nerves, vasculature, connective tissue, bone,
        lacrimal and zygomatic glands

-   Amount of retrobulbar space

    -   Dolichocephalic - Lots

    -   Mesaticephalic - Medium

    -   Brachycephalic – Little

Primary Clinical Signs
======================

-   Exophthalmia

    -   Definition: Abnormal protrusion or bulging forward of the
        eyeball.

        -   Exophthalmia is the principle clinical sign in dogs with
            orbital disease

        -   Most easily seen by viewing animal from above

    -   Etiologies:

        -   ANY SPACE-OCCUPYING RETROBULBAR LESION

        -   Neoplasia

        -   Cellulitis

        -   Traumatic proptosis

-   Ocular deviation

-   Third eyelid protrusion

-   Reduced retropulsion

Secondary Clinical Signs
========================

-   Periocular pain

-   Pain on opening the mouth

-   Periocular swelling

-   Retinal lesions

-   Auscultable bruit

Diseases of the Orbit
=====================

Retrobulbar Neoplasia
---------------------

-   Definition: Cancer of the orbit.

-   Clinical signs / history

    -   Older animals

    -   Slowly progressive exophthalmia

    -   Third eyelid protrusion

    -   Not painful on opening the mouth

    -   ± ocular deviation

    -   ± retinal indentation

    -   Oral cavity exam normal

-   Etiology (i.e., most common tumor types):

    -   In general, malignant

    -   Most commonly mesenchymal

        -   Fibrosarcoma

        -   Osteosarcoma

    -   Carcinomas

    -   Other orbital tissues (e.g., MCT, hemangiosarcoma, meningioma,
        etc)

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Clinical signs / history

    -   Ultrasound

    -   Advanced imaging

        -   I tend to prefer CT to MRI for suspected orbital neoplasms
            because of its superior definition of bony invasion, which I
            find to be very helpful for prognosis.

        -   If there is very little chance that bony invasion has
            occurred (e.g., for suspected optic nerve meningioma) MRI
            usually gives better tissue definition of the tumor

    -   Skull radiographs add very little to the diagnosis

    -   Fine needle aspirate

-   Treatment:

    -   In general, by the time they’re diagnosed its often too late to
        successfully treat.

    -   When you do treat, it’s usually palliative, not curative.

    -   Orbitotomy or exenteration followed by radiation therapy.

Retrobulbar Cellulitis (also called retrobulbar abscess)
--------------------------------------------------------

-   Definition: Inflammation of orbital tissues. Infectious; almost
    always bacterial; rare reports of fungal

-   Clinical signs / history:

    -   Rapidly developing exophthalmia

    -   Painful on opening the mouth due to pressure of mandibular ramus
        on inflamed retrobulbar tissues

    -   Painful on orbital and periorbital palpation

    -   Eye looks “hotter” than neoplasia eye (more apt to have
        conjunctivitis, swollen lids, etc.)

-   Etiology:

    -   Organisms enter orbit following puncture of pterygoid muscle
        behind last molar; e.g., bone, stick, etc.

    -   Infection of molar roots

        -   Canassial tooth root abscess appears rostral to the eye, not
            in orbit

    -   Nasal cavity - uncommon

    -   Ear canal - uncommon

    -   Hematogenous - uncommon

-   Diagnosis

    -   Clinical signs

    -   Ultrasound

    -   Drainage and culture via oral incision

-   Treatment

    -   Oral antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity; can also
        shotgun with -lactams

    -   Common organisms

        -   Staph

        -   E. coli

        -   Bacteroides (anaerobic)

        -   Clostridium (anaerobic)

        -   Pasteurella

    -   Best empirical antibiotics

        -   Cefpodoxime

        -   Amoxicillin-clavulonate

    -   Antibiotic therapy relatively long term (at least 3 weeks)

    -   ± drainage via oral cavity

-   Sequelae

    -   Usually rapid resolution

    -   Enophthalmia may occur due to loss of retrobulbar fat

    -   Extension into calvarium is exceedingly rare (as opposed to
        neoplasia)

Traumatic Proptosis
-------------------

-   Definition: As used here, implies an extreme forward displacement of
    the globe, such that the equator of the globe is anterior to the
    eyelid margins.

-   Clinical signs / history

    -   Proptosis

    -   H/O dog fight, HBC

    -   Usually seen in brachycephalics

-   Etiology:

    -   Trauma, with rupture of extraocular muscles and intense
        retrobulbar swelling that prevents reduction.

-   Diagnosis:

    -   Exam

-   Treatment

    -   Clean thoroughly

    -   Reduce, place temporary tarsorrhaphy

    -   Leave up 2-3 weeks

    -   Topical antibiotics and lubricants through medial canthal
        opening

    -   Systemic antibiotics for 1 week

    -   Enucleation is appropriate for cases of extreme proptosis

-   Sequelae/Prognosis

    -   Usually blind

    -   Prognosis especially bad for non-brachycephalics (takes more
        serious trauma to proptose eyes in these animals).

    -   Lateral strabismus due to medial rectus .avulsion

    -   Corneal desiccation and KCS
